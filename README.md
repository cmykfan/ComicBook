# ComicBook
A simple CRUD app built with Visual Studio, MVC, SQL, Entity Framework and C#.  A comicbook database in which you can view titles/artists, edit, add or delete them.

This is a work in progress and I am wanting to add a second part in which users can list their favorite comic book shops and addresses, as of 8-1-18 this hasn't been implimented yet and the ComicBook Store link will result in an error.  Also this project should start at the Index page which doesn't have much information, please click the Titles link at the top and this will bring you to the CRUD database.
