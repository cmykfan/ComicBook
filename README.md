# ComicBook
A simple CRUD app built with Visual Studio, MVC, SQL, Entity Framework and C# using Localdb.  

A comicbook database in which you can view titles/artists, edit, add or delete them.

This is a work in progress and I am wanting to add a second part in which users can list their favorite comic book shops and addresses, this hasn't been implimented yet and the Comic Store link will result in an error.  

Also this project should start at the Index page which doesn't have much information, please click the Titles link at the top and this will bring you to the CRUD database.

This should run if you double-click the ComicBook Visual Studio Project file directly inside the ComicBook-master folder that has been downloaded from my GitHub and unzipped.  

Once you double-click the file it should load in Visual Studio 2017 Community and then you can hit the run button.

You should be greeted with a blank database in which you can start adding titles/artists and once you add a few titles you can then view, edit and delete and view the results.

This was tested on two different Windows 7 Pro machines with VS Community 2017.
