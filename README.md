# ComicBook
A simple CRUD app built with Visual Studio, MVC, SQL, Entity Framework and C#.  A comicbook database in which you can view titles/artists, edit, add or delete them.

This is a work in progress and I am wanting to add a second part in which users can list their favorite comic book shops and addresses, as of 8-1-18 this hasn't been implimented yet and the ComicBook Store link will result in an error.
