# ComicBook
Update 1/26/2024:  It's been a while since I looked at this app.  Definitely having issues with Windows 11 and VS 2022.
I am working on this under Windows 10 and VS 2019.  Looks like I have an issue with MS.Net.Compilers 2.6.1 since it's
depricated and no longer updating.   Looking into how to use MS.Net.Compilers.Toolset and work it into code.
Fair warning, this may not work when viewing this project at this time.  I figure at least I can show my methods of
working through a problem to get it resolved.

A simple CRUD app built with Visual Studio, MVC, SQL, Entity Framework and C# using Localdb.  

A comicbook database in which you can view titles/artists, edit, add or delete them.

This is a work in progress and I am wanting to add a second part in which users can list their favorite comic book shops and addresses, this hasn't been implimented yet and the Comic Store link will result in an error.  

Also this project should start at the Index page which doesn't have much information, please click the Titles link at the top and this will bring you to the CRUD database.

This should run if you double-click the ComicBook Visual Studio Project file directly inside the ComicBook-master folder that has been downloaded from my GitHub and unzipped.  

Once you double-click the file it should load in Visual Studio 2017 Community and then you can hit the run button.

You should be greeted with a blank database in which you can start adding titles/artists and once you add a few titles you can then view, edit and delete and view the results.

This was tested on two different Windows 7 Pro machines with VS Community 2017.
